# React-Projects

Here's a set of foundational React projects that have been carefully crafted to enable a thorough understanding of the key features of hooks and states in ReactJS. This repository differs from a previous JavaScript-focused repository I've previously put together in that it only contains projects created with ReactJS.


Developers can improve their knowledge of ReactJS and hone their front-end development abilities by working on these projects. Despite being simple, these projects provide a priceless learning opportunity and only need a small time and effort commitment. These projects, which include a wide range of apps like a calculator, stopwatch, to-do list, and notes app, are useful building blocks for for those who want to improve their development skills using ReactJS.


This repository is a work in progress, with plans to add more projects in the future. The idea is to encourage developers to explore, create, and hone their art in order to inspire a never-ending journey of development and coding. These ReactJS projects are a great starting point for anyone trying to learn the basics or upgrade their skills. They are a great resource for developers of all skill levels. So let's get started on this path of coding, and may creativity flourish in each and every line of code!

This GitHub Repository consists of the following basic reactjs applications :

1. Agency Website using Tailwind CSS
2. Calculator
3. Drag & Drop functionality
4. Notes Application
5. Stopwatch
6. To Do List
7. Weather Application
