# ToDo List

This project was one of the most easiest ot do after learning reactJS. And after making the notes application, it became a hell lot easier! I simply made two components, one that added tasks and the other one that handled display of items, checks and deletions. I used 3 states, one for tasks, the other one to search and set those tasks, and the third one for checks on the tasks that have been accomplished, that is, isActive and setIsActive. 

I used simple useStates and JSON.parse methods to save the data in the local storage. I created an array with id and task that I saved in the local storage and mapped through every item of the task to display the task of tasks array or item of the tasks array.
